## prepare Data for hook occupancy model



```{r }
PrepareDataHookModel()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
FixedSurvey<-FixedSurveyData()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
