## Halibut Update

This is the Halibut landing data for SCAL data input. Multiple data sources were utilized to generate landing by gear (LL, OT, and others) and area (3 and 4) from 1970 to 2019. 

The following section is the setup: load packages, set year ranges, and specify the path of the data inputs d.

## Landings Data: NAFO landings data 21A

To get the NAFO landings data 21A, download from here: https://www.nafo.int/Data/STATLANT. Select HAL - ATLANTIC HALIBUT as the species and save the exported data as Export.csv. 

To get the NAFO landings data 21B, download from here:
https://www.nafo.int/Data/Catch-Statistics. There are multiple zipped files each with  one decade's data except the most recent one. Save and unzip all of them.

There are three different landing datasets. NAFO landing 21A contains division and year; NAFO landing 21B contains gear in addition to division and year; MARFIS also contains gear but only for Maritimes with shorter time series. 21B landing is complete before 2000. In 1970s, 21A landing was considerably lower than 21B with Areas 4 missing in many years. From 1980 to 2000, total landing is similar between 21A and 21B. Since 2001, landing of 21B is missing for several years and divisions while data are complete in MARFIS and 21A; landing 21B was considerably lower than 21A in both area 3 and 4.

To fill missing data in Areas 3 in 21B since 2001,the proportion of landing by gear in each division for 21B was estimated and used to scale 21A as total landing. The division-specific gear proportion was calculated as an average of previous three years for each missing year and estimated each year for the rest of available years. The landing updates increased landing of 21B area 3 to the same as 21A since 2001. 


```{r landings by division/gear for areas 3 2001-yendB}
# 21B catch much smaller than A since 2001 and missing 2014
# division landing from 21A 

# landing 21B since 2001
 nafoB03= nafoB  %>%
     filter(grepl("3", Division)) %>%
     filter (Year>=2001)%>%
     replace(is.na(.), 0) 
   
## prop for the missing year = average the previous three years
 propBm= as.data.frame(est_prop(nafoB03, 3, 2014))
 
## Prop for other years since 2001
 propB1 =as.data.frame( est_prop(nafoB03, 1, 2014)) %>%
   filter(Year!=2014)
## prop since 2001 21B
 propB= rbind( propB1,propBm )
 
 nafoA03 = nafoA  %>%
   filter(Year>=2001)
 
 ## est landing by div gear since 2001
 nafoBA03 = merge(nafoA03, propB)  %>%
   mutate(Catch = CatchA*Prop)  %>%
   dplyr::select(Year,Division, Gear, Catch)

```


To fill Areas 4 in 21B since 2001, the proportion of landing by gear in each division was estimated annually for MARFIS and used to scale 21A as total landing. Catch by OT was missing in some divisions of Area 4 in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000 and replaced with zero. The updates increased landing of 21B Area 4 to the same as 21A since 2001. 


```{r proportion by gear for areas 4 since 2001 }

# MARFIS: proportion by gear 

propM =as.data.frame( est_prop(mar, avg=1))%>%
   filter(Year>=2001& Year <=yend)%>%
   filter(grepl("4", Division)) 

# est landing by div gear for Area 4 since 2001
 nafoBM04 = merge(nafoA03, propM) %>%
   mutate(Catch = CatchA*Prop)  %>%
   dplyr::select(Year,Division, Gear, Catch)

 # ested landing in Areas 3 &4 since 2001
  nafoBAM34 = as.data.frame(rbind(nafoBM04, nafoBA03)) 

# compare estimated landing since 2001 with 21A; estimated div catch = 21A
#   nafoBAM34.div = nafoBAM34  %>%
#    group_by(Year, Division)  %>%
#    summarise(CATCH=sum(Catch)) 
# nafoBAM34.dif= merge(nafoBAM34.div, nafoA03, all.y = T)  %>%
#   mutate(catchD= CatchA-CATCH)
```

As there was no data since 2017 in 21B, landing by gear was estimated as the sum of Canadian landing and foreign landing each year and division. Maritimes and NL landing were combined as Canadian landing in Area 3; Maritimes landing represents Canadian landing in Area 4. The estimate was very similar to Canadian landing in Area 3 and 4 in 21A (<23.6 ton) and used as Canadian landing for 21B.

Foreign landing by gear and division was estimated as applying the annual gear proportion from NL landing and MARFIS to scale the total landing in Area 3 and 4. The total landing was extracted from 21A with all countries excluding Canada. As 4X was the only division in Area 4 where foreign landing occurred based on 21A, the annual gear proportion in 4X from MARFIS was used to scale the total foreign landing in Area 4. For Area 3, the annual gear proportion in each division was utilized  based on NL landing.
